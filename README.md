Day 11 of Waves of Food development, focusing on Day 4 of the admin panel. Added a key feature: "Out For Delivery" tab with real-time order and payment tracking. Orders can now display payment status in colors (Received, Not Received, Pending). This feature ensures admins have easy access to customer information, payment updates, and delivery statuses.
